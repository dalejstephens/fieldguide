# Start Here :) 

I’m writing this document with two goals in mind:

Sharing what I learned after a decade in San Francisco
Putting the expertise I share with coaching clients into a central place

I’ve broken Dale’s Field Guide to Startups down into three sections (for now):

*Self-management
*Company management
*Team management 

To start, I’m going to compile links to the best resources & eventually share more of my own experiences.

When reading, I want you to keep a couple things in mind:

+Take everything with a grain of salt
+There is no “right way” to be a human or run a business. Figuring that out for yourself is *part* of the journey 
+This is a living document -- I will add, edit, and change it over time. Comments are always welcome.

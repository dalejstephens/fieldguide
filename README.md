# Start Here :) 

I’m writing this document with two goals in mind:

Sharing what I learned after a decade in San Francisco
Putting the expertise I share with coaching clients into a central place

I’ve broken Dale’s Field Guide to Startups down into three sections (for now):

1. Self-management
2. Company management
3. Team management 

When reading, I want you to keep a couple things in mind:

1. Take everything with a grain of salt.
2. There is no “right way” to be a human or run a business. Figuring that out for yourself is *part* of the journey. 
3. This is a living document -- I will add, edit, and change it over time. Comments are always welcome.
4. To begin, I'm going to link and cite as much as I can & over time I'll add my own details.
